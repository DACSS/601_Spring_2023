And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte\nshould check out his [fantastic\nbooks](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on\ndata visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R\npackage and command.\n\n-   eggs ⭐\n-   abc_poll ⭐⭐\n-   australian_marriage ⭐⭐\n-   hotel_bookings ⭐⭐⭐\n-   air_bnb ⭐⭐⭐\n-   us_hh ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n-   faostat ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n data <- read.csv(\"_data/AB_NYC_2019.csv\")\n head(data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    id                                             name host_id   host_name\n1 2539               Clean & quiet apt home by the park    2787        John\n2 2595                            Skylit Midtown Castle    2845    Jennifer\n3 3647              THE VILLAGE OF HARLEM....NEW YORK !

Each entry represents a unique rental unit and includes 16 variables that offer a range of details. These details include the unit's ID, name, location, host ID and name, room type, price, minimum nights required for booking, number of reviews, date of the last review, average monthly reviews, calculated count of host listings on Airbnb, and availability.\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nIs your data already tidy, or is there work to be done?
