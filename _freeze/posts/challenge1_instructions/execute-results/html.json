Then you can read in the data, using either one of the `readr` standard tidy read commands, or a specialized package such as `readxl`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
