Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Univariate Visualizations\n\n\n## Bivariate Visualization(s)\nAny additional comments?\n",
