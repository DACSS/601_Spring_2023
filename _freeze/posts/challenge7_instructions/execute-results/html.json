And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte should check out his [fantastic books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on data visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.\n\n  - eggs ⭐\n  - abc_poll ⭐⭐\n  - australian_marriage ⭐⭐\n  - hotel_bookings ⭐⭐⭐\n  - air_bnb  ⭐⭐⭐\n  - us_hh ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n  - faostat ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Briefly describe the data\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nIs your data already tidy, or is there work to be done? Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Visualization with Multiple Dimensions\n\n\n",
