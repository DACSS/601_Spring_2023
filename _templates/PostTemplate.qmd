## Instructions

This document provides yaml header inforamtion you will need to replicate each week to submit your homework or other blog posts. Please observe the following conventions:

-   Save your own copy of this template as a blog post in the `posts` folder, naming it `FirstLast_hwX.qmd`
-   Edit the yaml header to change your author name - use the same name each week
-   include a *description* that is reader friendly
-   update the *category* list to indicate the type of submission, the data used, the main packages or techniques, your name, or any thing else to make your document easy to find
-   edit as a normal qmd/rmd file


```{r}
x <- c(2,3,4,5)
mean(x)
```

## Rendering your post

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. 

:::{.callout-warning}
Be sure that you have moved your `*.qmd` file into the `posts` folder **BEFORE** you render it, so that all files are stored in the correct location.
:::

:::{.callout-important}
Only render a single file - don't try to render the whole website!

## Pilot Student Blogs

We are piloting a workflow including individual student websites with direted and limited pull requests back to course blogs. Please let us know if you would like to participate.

## Reading in data files

The easiest data source to use - at least initially - is to choose something easily accessible, either from our `_data` folder provided, or from an online source that is publicly available.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Using Other Data
If you would like to use a source that you have access to and it is small enough and you don't mind making it public, you can copy it into the `_data` file and include in your *commit* and *pull request*.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Using Private Data

If you would like to use a proprietary source of data, that should be possible using the same process outlined above. There may initially be a few issues. We hope to have this feature working smoothly soon!
