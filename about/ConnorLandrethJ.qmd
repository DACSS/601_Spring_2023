## Education/Work Background
In the nascent stages of my career, I have taken a unique route in public sector work, national defense, and nuclear deterrence after graduating from Washington State University with an economics degree. I started my career working on a cybersecurity partnership with the Department of Defense. After getting a taste for the impact this type of work could have, I began working with Sandia National Laboratories under the Department of Energy as a lean process engineer, working on nuclear weapons programs. Currently, I am an analyst with the government and public services division at Deloitte.

## R experience
Coming into the DACSS program, I have very limited knowledge of R beyond the fundamentals. 

## Research interests
Development economics, national defense, suicide

## Hometown
Chicago, IL

## Hobbies
I love watching basketball, playing pool at dive bars, and spending time with family whenever I am able.

## Fun fact
Between the ages of 15 and 22, I have lived in Ohio, California, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, and now Illinois.
