<p>###Tidy Data</p>
<p>The only thing that I noticed to change was that pphhsize was a character instead of a numerical variable. The value “6 or more” was changed to “6” and the column was changed to numerical. It is stacked data with each row representing an observation and a variable in each column. There appears to be no missing values.</p>

<p>Are there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, are all time variables correctly coded as dates? Are all string variables reduced and cleaned to sensible categories? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?</p>
<p>The mutate function and na.if was used above to remove the “Skipped” data. Below, I created a function just for practice and used the mutate function to add a column to df1 with the z-score of the age. Practicing using R and seeing the distribution of the age variable. The histogram shows the distribution of the age of the respondents in the poll.</p>
